# product-security-lab
Hands-on Product Security lab demonstrating secure SDLC, CI/CD hardening, dependency scanning, SBOM generation, and cloud security automation.

# Product Security Lab

This repository demonstrates hands-on implementation of Product Security practices across the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). 

The objective of this lab is to simulate how modern engineering teams secure build pipelines, software supply chains, containers, cloud infrastructure, and developer workflows.

---

## Scope of This Project

This lab covers:

- Secure SDLC integration
- CI/CD pipeline hardening (GitHub Actions)
- Software supply chain defense
- SBOM generation and dependency verification
- Docker container security
- Cloud security configuration basics
- Security automation using Python

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- Linux CLI
- AWS (foundational concepts)
- Security scanning tools
- SBOM tools

---

## Goal

To demonstrate how security can be embedded directly into engineering workflows rather than treated as a post-development activity.

Each folder in this repository represents a focused implementation area aligned with modern Product Security engineering practices.
